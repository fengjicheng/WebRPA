export const moduleReferenceContentEn = `# Module Reference

This page walks through the modules by sidebar category, for when you know what you want to do but not which module does it.
Each group starts with what it is for and how modules combine, then lists the modules. For full configuration details and worked examples, jump to the matching topic guide.

> Three ways to find a module: (1) browse by category here; (2) type Chinese, pinyin or pinyin initials into the module search box on the left (typing \`dkwy\` finds "Open page"); (3) ask the AI assistant "which module do I use to do X".

## Additional web automation modules

### Page navigation

Page-level operations that go with "Open page". Iframes are the usual trap: an embedded iframe is a separate document, and until you switch into it you will never find the elements inside.

| Module | What it does |
|------|------|
| Close page | Closes the current tab, usually at the end of a workflow to free resources |
| Switch iframe | Enters the given iframe; later element operations apply inside it |
| Switch back to main page | Leaves the iframe; forgetting this makes later main-page elements unreachable |
| Page load complete | Writes the load state into a variable for conditions; does not block the flow |

### Element interaction and queries

"Element exists" and "Element visible" write a boolean into a variable, which is the basis of robust flows: check first, then act, instead of clicking an element that has not appeared yet.

| Module | What it does |
|------|------|
| Checkbox | Checks / unchecks a box by target state rather than blind clicking |
| Element exists | Whether the element is present in the DOM, result into a variable |
| Element visible | Whether the element is visible (false when present but hidden) |
| Extract table data | Reads an entire HTML table into a list, far faster than cell-by-cell |

### Data collection: network monitoring

When the data on screen cannot be scraped (filled in by JS, or paging goes through an API), listening to the responses is more reliable. The three modules are used together in order.

| Module | What it does |
|------|------|
| Start network monitor | Turns on monitoring; requests from then on are recorded |
| Wait for API request | Blocks until a request matching the URL completes, response body into a variable |
| Stop network monitor | Turns monitoring off and frees resources |

Typical order: Start network monitor → Click element (triggers the request) → Wait for API request → Stop network monitor.

### DP anti-detection automation

Use this set (built on DrissionPage) when normal browser automation gets flagged by a site's bot protection. It behaves closer to a real user, at the cost of fewer advanced capabilities. These modules form their own stack — do not mix them with the regular web modules on the same page.

| Module | What it does |
|------|------|
| DP open page | Starts the DP browser and opens a URL |
| DP click element | Clicks (CSS / XPath locators) |
| DP input text | Types into an input box |
| DP get text | Reads element text into a variable |
| DP get HTML | Reads element or page HTML into a variable |
| DP run JS | Runs JavaScript in page context |
| DP wait element | Waits for an element so actions are not too early |
| DP scroll page | Scrolls the page, used to trigger lazy loading |
| DP close browser | Closes the DP browser and frees the process |

## Additional desktop and screen automation modules

### Image recognition and text clicking

The fallback when neither web nor desktop element locating works (Flash, Canvas, remote desktop views). The downside is dependence on screen resolution and theme, so it breaks easily across machines — keep it below element locating in priority.

| Module | What it does |
|------|------|
| Click text | OCRs the screen for the given text and clicks it |
| Hover text | Finds the text and hovers over it (to open hover menus) |

### Screen and recording

| Module | What it does |
|------|------|
| Record screen | Records the screen to a video file, often to keep evidence of a failed run |

### Desktop application control operations

This whole set is the core of Windows desktop automation (built on UIAutomation). The pattern is fixed: get an application handle variable via "Start application" or "Connect application", get a control handle variable via "Find control", then base every operation on those two handles.

| Module | What it does |
|------|------|
| Window state control | Minimize / maximize / restore a window |
| Input text into control | Writes text into input-type controls (steadier than simulating the keyboard) |
| Get control text | Reads the control's displayed text into a variable |
| Set control value | Sets the control's value directly (dropdowns, spin boxes, etc.) |
| Operate radio button | Selects the given radio button |
| Send hotkey | Sends a key combination to the control (e.g. Ctrl+S) |
| Get control property | Reads any UIAutomation property into a variable |
| Batch extract list | Reads all rows of a list / table control into a list at once |
| Application state snapshot | Captures a summary of the current control tree, very useful when locating fails |
| Find control by XPath | Locates controls with XPath-like syntax, good for deep trees without unique identifiers |
| Select and extract text | Selects text inside a control and extracts it, for controls whose text cannot be read directly |
| Scroll control | Scrolls a list / panel control to load more content |

> When a control cannot be located, work through this order: (1) use "Application state snapshot" to see what it is actually called in the control tree; (2) use "Wait for control" instead of finding it immediately; (3) switch to "Find control by XPath" and locate by hierarchy.

### Phone automation

| Module | What it does |
|------|------|
| Click text | Finds the given text on the phone screen and taps it (connect the device first) |

---

## Additional flow control and trigger modules

### Flow control

| Module | What it does |
|------|------|
| Infinite loop | Loops until "Break loop" stops it. The index variable defaults to \`loop_index\` (note the "Loop" module defaults to \`index\`); always write a working exit condition inside the body |
| Assertion / checkpoint | Verifies a variable / element / expression against expectations, then aborts or just records depending on configuration. Use it to produce readable results in automated testing |
| Force stop workflow | Ends the whole workflow immediately; you can log a stop reason |
| Run another workflow | Runs another workflow file as a sub-flow, for reuse and for splitting large flows |

### Triggers

| Module | What it does |
|------|------|
| Gesture trigger | Uses the camera to recognise a gesture and trigger the flow, with configurable confidence threshold and timeout; the result goes into a variable |

---

## Additional data processing modules

### List operations

List modules follow one convention: input is a list variable name, output goes into a result variable. They never modify the original list, which makes chaining easy.

| Module | What it does |
|------|------|
| Export list | Writes the list to a file (CSV / JSON, etc.) |
| Sum list | Sums a numeric list |
| Average list | Averages a numeric list |
| Max of list | Takes the maximum |
| Min of list | Takes the minimum |
| Sort list | Ascending / descending, optionally by field |
| Deduplicate list | Removes duplicate elements |
| Slice list | Takes a sub-list by start and end index |
| Reverse list | Reverses the order |
| Find in list | Finds an element and returns its index or the element |
| Count list | Counts occurrences of an element |
| Filter list | Keeps elements matching a condition |
| Map list | Applies one transformation to every element |
| Flatten list | Flattens nested lists into one level |
| Chunk list | Splits into fixed-size groups, handy for batch processing |
| Remove empty from list | Drops empty strings / null elements |
| List intersection | Elements present in both lists |
| List union | Merges two lists and deduplicates |
| List difference | Elements only in the first list |
| List cartesian product | Every combination of two lists |
| Shuffle list | Randomises the order |
| Sample list | Picks N random elements |
| List to string (advanced) | Joins with a separator, with optional prefix/suffix and field selection |

### Dictionary operations

| Module | What it does |
|------|------|
| Dict keys | Takes all keys as a list |
| Merge dicts | Merges two dicts; the second overrides same-named keys |
| Filter dict | Keeps entries matching a condition |
| Map dict values | Applies one transformation to every value |
| Invert dict | Swaps keys and values |
| Sort dict | Sorts by key or value |
| Deep copy dict | Copies a dict so the two are independent |
| Get dict path | Reads a nested value via a path like \`a.b.c\`, easier than level-by-level access |
| Flatten dict | Flattens a nested dict into one level with path-style keys |

> When handling JSON from an API, "Get dict path" plus "Flatten dict" is the most useful pair: the first pulls one exact field, the second shows you the whole structure at once.

### Math and statistics

| Module | What it does |
|------|------|
| Modulo | Remainder |
| Nth root | Any root (square root by default) |
| Power | Any exponent |
| Logarithm | Custom base supported |
| Exponential | Natural exponential |
| Permutation and combination | Computes permutations / combinations |
| Clamp number | Clamps a value into [min, max] to prevent out-of-range values |
| Random number (advanced) | Integer / float, with distribution and precision options |
| Normalize data | Scales a set of numbers into 0–1 |
| Standardize data | Z-score transformation using mean and standard deviation |

| Module | What it does |
|------|------|
| Add sheet | Creates a sheet |
| Delete sheet | Deletes the given sheet |
| Insert rows | Inserts blank rows at a position |
| Insert columns | Inserts blank columns at a position |
| Delete columns | Deletes the given columns |
| Read formula / value | The key setting is "read content": choose "value" for the computed result, "formula" for text like \`=SUM(A1:A9)\`. Getting a formula string instead of a number means this option is set wrong |
| Set hyperlink | Adds a link to a cell |
| Set comment | Adds a comment to a cell |
| First empty column | Finds the first empty column, used for appending data |
| First empty cell | Finds the first empty cell, used to locate the write position |

---

## Database modules

All seven database families share the same structure, so learning one teaches you all: **connect → operate → disconnect**. The connect module writes a connection handle into a variable, later modules find the connection through it, and you must disconnect at the end to release it.

> Shared notes:
> - Query modules produce a list-of-dicts structure that feeds straight into "Foreach list" for row-by-row processing.
> - Write modules return the affected row count, which you can verify with "Assertion / checkpoint".
> - When interpolating variables into SQL, mind injection risk: prefer the module's parameter fields over hand-built strings.
> - Disconnect even when the flow exits abnormally: put the disconnect at the end of the workflow and clean up before "Force stop workflow".

## When you cannot find the module you want

1. Search the sidebar by **capability words** first ("compress", "dedup", "screenshot"); keywords beyond the module name also match.
2. Then ask the AI assistant: describe the goal ("dedup phone numbers in this Excel file and write them back") and it will suggest a module combination.
3. If there really is no matching module, wrap a piece of Python / JS logic into a reusable module with "Custom module", or write the logic directly with "Run Python script".
